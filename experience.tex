\experience{Amazon}{Seattle, CA}{Machine Learning Intern}{Summer 2016}{
\item Designed and implemented an interactive machine learning algorithm for classification of low-frequency events in Amazonâ€™s marketplace. Built a UI using ReactJS 
\item Upgraded prototype search engine from gradient boosting machines to a deep learning model
\item Built a deep representation learning model for consumer activity 
\item Built a Go data pipeline for deep causal inference modeling Amazon customer behavior 
}

\experience{Counsyl}{San Francisco, CA}{Software Engineering Intern}{Summer 2014}{
\item Designed and implemented an algorithm to predict the pathogenicity mutations in the genome. Used a generative statistical clustering model to model mutations and used EM for inference. Paper can be read on \href{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/021527v1}{\link{bioRxiv}}.

}

\experience{RewardMe}{Mountain View, CA}{Software Engineering Intern}{Summer 2012}{
\item Worked on Android Bluetooth Serial communication with an Android app
\item Worked with Google Maps API to create a realtime monitoring tool
\item Integrated Cardspring API with a JBoss/MySQL backend
\item Wrote an iOS credit card reader app
}

\experience{Cubic Transportation Systems}{San Diego, CA}{Software Engineering Intern}{Summer 2011}{
\item Designed and implemented a UI in GWT and ExtGWT for a Java application monitoring tool
\item Used DAO to access and manipulate a Derby database
\item Implemented a mobile version of the UI in ExtJS
}

\experience{San Diego Supercomputer Center}{San Diego, CA}{Software Engineering Intern}{Summer 2010}{
\item Worked in the San Diego Supercomputer Center under Dr. Amarnath Gupta; used GWT to
design a search interface that would query a large neuroscience database; interface was
unique in that it would back-check queries for contextual errors
