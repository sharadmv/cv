\experience{Google Research}{San Francisco, CA}{Researcher}{2019 -- Present}{
\item (2022 -- Present) JAX Team
\begin{itemize}
    \item JAX core development 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Full-stack JAX expert (large-scale ML, functional programming, program transformations, automatic differentiation, side-effects, interfacing with ML compilers and runtimes on CPU/GPU/TPU)
        \item Designed and implemented JAX's new side-effect system, enabling a new generation of side-effect-aware JAX transformations (debugging side-effects, error handling, mutable state, PRNG key reuse)
        \item Designed and implemented JAX \href{https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging/index.html}{\link{debugging features}} (debug printing, Python callbacks).
        \item Across-the-board JAX contributions (sharding visualization, error effects, FFI, and more)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Creator and lead for \href{https://github.com/jax-ml/jax-triton}{\link{JAX-Triton and Pallas}}, Python front-ends for writing custom GPU kernels that integrate with JAX.
\end{itemize}
\item (2019 -- 2022) TensorFlow Probability Team
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probabilistic programming
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Creator and lead for \href{https://github.com/jax-ml/oryx}{\link{Oryx}}, a probabilistic programming language built on JAX based on functional program transformations. Oryx is used throughout Google for Bayesian modeling and state handling.
        \item Designed and implemented \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/Distributed_Inference_with_JAX}{\link{abstractions for distributed Bayesian inference}}, used to scale MCMC and VI to hundreds or thousands of accelerators.
        \item Added a \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/TensorFlow_Probability_on_JAX}{\link{JAX backend for TensorFlow Probability}}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Methodological research
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``What are Bayesian Neural Network Posteriors Really Like?'' -- ICML 2021
        \item ``Automatic structured variational inference.'' -- AISTATS 2021
        \item ``Differentiation Variational Inference with Mixtures'' -- AISTATS 2021
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Integrated Cardspring API with a JBoss/MySQL backend
\item Wrote an iOS credit card reader app
}

\experience{Cubic Transportation Systems}{San Diego, CA}{Software Engineering Intern}{Summer 2011}{
\item Designed and implemented a UI in GWT and ExtGWT for a Java application monitoring tool
\item Used DAO to access and manipulate a Derby database
\item Implemented a mobile version of the UI in ExtJS
}

\experience{San Diego Supercomputer Center}{San Diego, CA}{Software Engineering Intern}{Summer 2010}{
\item Worked in the San Diego Supercomputer Center under Dr. Amarnath Gupta; used GWT to
design a search interface that would query a large neuroscience database; interface was
unique in that it would back-check queries for contextual errors
