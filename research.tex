\research{University of California Berkeley}{Berkeley, CA}{Advisor - Stuart Russell}{2012 -- 2014}{
\emph{2012 -- 2013}:  Worked with Lei Li on gesture recognition using the dynamic time warping algorithm.
Extended existing SOTA dynamic time warping similarity search techniques to multiple dimensions,
designed and implemented a gesture recognition system. Extended abstract accepted into CHI
2013\\\vspace{2pt}
\emph{2014 -- 2015}: Worked with \href{https://davmre.github.io/}{\link{Dave Moore}} on Gaussian process regression for earthquake and nuclear test detection. Worked on adding non-Gaussian noise models to the existing observation model. Used various approximate inference techniques such as Laplace approximation and expectation propagation
